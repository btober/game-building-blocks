Game Building Blocks for Processing
===================================

As part of **ARTD 313 Digital Interaction**, a course taught in the [School of Art + Design](http://art.illinois.edu) at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](http://www.illinois.edu), students learn basic programming skills in [Processing](http://www.processing.org) through the design and development of an interactive game. Most, if not all, students begin the course with absolutely no programming experience, so many of them are understandably apprehensive about the notion of creating a game from nothing in the span of a few weeks.

Processing, "a programming language, development environment, and online community" that "promote[s] software literacy within the visual arts and visual literacy within technology," frames learning to code as involving "looking at lots of other code: running, altering, breaking, and enhancing it until you can reshape it into something new" [1]. As both a learning method and as general practice, the re-use of code written by others is actively encouraged within creative code communities [2].

In the first stage of the project, students brainstorm a functional flow structure for their desired game. Opportunities for leveraging existing sources of relevant code, which include the *Game Building Blocks for Processing*, as well as other pieces of code that developers have freely shared elsewhere, are identified at this point. It is then up to the students to analyze these pieces of code, understand how they operate, and synthesize/extend them to form their envisioned game [3].

The *Blocks* are not intended to be fully realized and refined games, nor are they examples of highly optimized code. Rather, they focus on demonstrating basic game component logic through neatly formatted code that has been commented in detail.


Blocks
------

- **circle\_square\_triangle** is an implementation of *Rock-paper-scissors*, played against the computer.
- **dodge\_enemies** demonstrates how to avoid moving enemies using keyboard-based movement.
- **item\_collecting** shows how to count the number of moving shapes collected using the mouse.
- **response\_time** tests how fast two players can press their corresponding keys on the keyboard.
- **shape\_tracing** challenges a player to accurately trace a displayed shape before time is up.
- **simple\_maze** tasks a player with navigating a cursor through a maze.
- **speed\_click** requires shapes to be clicked on in quick succession to be destroyed.
- **spot\_the\_difference** demonstrates a simple game with multiple levels.
- **word\_guess** has a player sequentially guess the letters of a randomly chosen word.

This project is in continued development, with more *Blocks* expected to be added over time.


Compatibility
-------------

All of the *Blocks* have been tested with Processing 2.0.3, in both Java and JavaScript modes.


Examples
--------

The following represent some of the games that have been designed and developed, in part, by using one or more of the *Blocks*:
